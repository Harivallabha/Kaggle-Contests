<H3>You can contribute solutions of different Kaggle contests.</H3>
Whenever you add a new contest, make a new folder for that and add Readme.md file for link to the contest if it doesn't exist already.
You can upload solutions in R or Python Language. It would be wonderful if you add Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
